h1. Preface

This is the little "project" where I'm going to keep gloryfied version of the 6-lines css code witch make ugly ugly ugly pages to more pleasent condition to my eyes.

h1. How to use

h2. Crome plugin

I'm using Crome browser.
For customising css on pages you want to have custom css there is a plugin. It's called "Personalized web":https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plcnnpdmhobdfbponjpedobekiogmbco
Install it and be carefull: it could change your life! =)

h2. Regular Expression

Stored in expression.txt

h2. CSS

Stored in css.css (oh I know, weird name)

h2. Font

I'm using a serif font "PT Serif". You can get by the "link":http://www.fontstock.com/public/PTSerif.zip
If you don't want to get your Fonts directory dirty, Georgia will serve you well.
Or, if you don't have Georgia, you will see default serif font of your browser.

And that's *all*! Happiness. Joy. =)
