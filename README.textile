h1. Preface
This is the little "project" in witch I'm going to keep gloryfied version of the 6-lines css code witch make ugly ugly ugly pages to more pleasent condition to my eyes.

h1. How to use

First, I must admit: I'm using Google Chrome. Usually, when I saw theese ugly manuals I spoke "F@ck!" and quikly sketched up some css to put it to the body tag of the page. But after reload all the uglinnes came up again.
So I discovered a chrome plugin called "Personalized web":https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plcnnpdmhobdfbponjpedobekiogmbco
And it changed my life!

=)

This is my own regular expression of the sites I want to change styling for:
bc. ^http://(www.freebsd.org|zsh.sourceforge.net|www.w3.org|comp-science.narod.ru|beej.us)/(doc/en/articles|Protocols|TR|DL-AR|[Gg]uide)*

and this is all of the css

@html body {
  max-width: 1000px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  font-family: "PT Serif", Georgia, serif;
  color: #444;
  font-size: 1.3em;
  line-height: 1.4em;
  padding: 1.8em 2em;
}
a {
  color: #00A !important;
}@

And that's *all*! Happynes. Joy. =)
